# GraphQL demo

Install node modules:

```sh
yarn
```

Run the node server with **babel-node** and **babel-watch**:

```sh
yarn run build
```

I use mongodb for the database. Please make sure the database is up and running and mongoose can connect to.

Go to http://localhost:4000 to use the GraphQL test utility `graphiql` and have your wonderful time!
